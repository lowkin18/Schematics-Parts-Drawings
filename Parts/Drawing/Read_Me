#SolidWorks Part Drawings

These are some of the parts I have designed for use in my hobby projects as well as school projects
They where designed with the limitations of 3D printing in mind as well as some benefits of 3D printing, Such as non manufacturable features.
The parts are all printed Using PLA and ABS.
